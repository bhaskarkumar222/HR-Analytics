## Situation  
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs, reduced productivity, and lower employee morale. HR teams need data-driven insights to understand **why employees leave, which departments are affected the most, and what factors contribute to attrition**.  

To address this, we developed an **HR Analytics Dashboard** that provides insights into **attrition rates, job satisfaction, performance and salary trends** using **Power BI and SQL**.

## Tools & Skills Used
* **SQL** – Querying and analyzing HR databases for attrition trends
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards for insights & trend analysis.

## Task  
The objective was to **Analyse employee attrition trends** and derive actionable insights. This involved identifying **key factors** influencing turnover, such as age, job role, salary, and performance. The findings aim to support strategic decision-making to enhance employee retention.

## Action
### Here are key problem questions to achieve the goal using SQL:

#### Attrition Analysis

1. What is the overall attrition rate?
2. What is the attrition rate by department, job role, or location?
3. What is the average tenure of employees who left vs. those who stayed?
4. What is the attrition rate by gender or age group?
5. What is the average salary of employees who left vs. those who stayed?
6. How does attrition vary by performance rating?
7. What is the attrition rate for employees who worked overtime vs. those who didn’t?

#### Performance Analysis

     - **Total Attrition, Attrition Rate & Average performancing Rating**
     - **Attrition by Age Group, Gender, Department, Salary, and Experience**
     - **Job Satisfaction Analysis**
     - Created visualizations using **Power BI** (bar charts, pie charts, Matrix).
